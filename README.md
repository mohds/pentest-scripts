# Pentest Scripts

## Summary
This is a collection of scripts that I developed for penetration testing. The scripts are split into 3 categories:
* Binary Exploitation
* SQL Injection
* Cross-site scripting

## Binary exploitation
This category contains scripts for exploiting bufferoverflows and format strings. Scripts are specified by levels. The levels are different binary challenges of increasing difficulty

## SQL Injection
This category contains scripts for fuzzing for SQL injection and exploiting SQL blind SQL injection and timed SQL injection with log(n) speed

## Cross-site scripting
This category contans scripts for fuzzing and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities

Feel free to suggest changes/issues. This project will always be a work in progress
